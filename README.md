## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome!
You can contribute in the following ways:
- If something doesn't work or you feel a feature is missing, open an issue in the relative section.
- Check in the issues section to see if there's a bug :bug: and open a PR to fix it.
- If you want to add a new feature, I suggest you to describe in a PR the feature you want to implement before writing tons of code, to see if the idea :bulb: fits to the project.
